# Neural Network & Genetic Algorithm Design

## Overview
This document explains the professional configuration for the racing AI system.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Sensor Ray Configuration** (9 rays)
**Before:** Inconsistent angles with redundancy
- Had ±0.01π (nearly duplicate of 0°)
- Uneven distribution: 0°, ±18°, ±45°, ±88°, ±90°

**After:** Even coverage from -90° to +90°
```
0°   - Straight ahead (critical forward planning)
±20° - Near forward (detect upcoming turns)
±40° - Mid angle (see track edges)
±60° - Wide angle (peripheral vision)
±90° - Full side (wall detection)
```

**Why:** Provides comprehensive 180° field of view with even distribution for balanced environment awareness.

### 2. **Neural Network Architecture**
**Before:** `[9, 3, 1]` - Only 3 hidden neurons
**After:** `[9, 6, 1]` - 6 hidden neurons

**Why:**
- 3 neurons was too constrained for 9 inputs
- Rule of thumb: hidden layer should be 0.5x to 2x input size
- 6 neurons allows more pattern recognition without overfitting
- Can capture complex racing strategies (corner entry, apex, exit)

**Alternative Architectures (commented in config):**
- `[9, 8, 1]` - More capacity for very complex tracks
- `[9, 8, 4, 1]` - Two hidden layers for hierarchical learning

### 3. **Genetic Algorithm Parameters**

**Mutation Rate:** 0.08 (was 0.1)
- Slightly reduced for more stable evolution
- Still allows good exploration
- Adaptive system increases this when needed

**Mutation Multiplier Range:** 0.2 to 1.5 (was 0.1 to 2.0)
- Reduced maximum from 2.0 to 1.5 (less extreme mutations)
- Increased minimum from 0.1 to 0.2 (more baseline diversity)
- Creates better balance between exploitation and exploration

**Mutation Curve Power:** 2.0 (was 0.2)
- Was nearly linear (0.2 = very flat curve)
- Now moderate exponential curve
- Effect: More cars with moderate mutation, fewer with extreme mutation
- Provides stable improvements while maintaining diversity

**Population Size:** 100 (unchanged)
- Good balance between diversity and speed
- Not too small (would lack diversity)
- Not too large (would slow evolution)

### 4. **Documentation Structure**
- Added comprehensive header explaining the entire system
- Organized into clear sections with semantic dividers
- Inline comments explain each parameter's purpose
- Added tuning tips for experimentation

## How the System Works

### Neural Network Flow
```
Sensors (9 rays) → Input Layer (9 neurons)
                         ↓
                  Hidden Layer (6 neurons)
                         ↓
                  Output Layer (1 neuron)
                         ↓
                  Steering Control (-1 to +1)
```

### Genetic Algorithm Flow
```
Generation N:
1. 100 cars spawn with mutated brains
2. Cars drive until crash/backwards/time limit
3. Fitness = max distance reached on centerline

Selection:
- Best car's brain → saved
- Elite car (index 0) → exact copy (no mutation)
- Cars 1-99 → mutations with progressive rates

Mutation:
- Car #1:  0.2× mutation (similar to elite)
- Car #50: 0.8× mutation (moderate exploration)
- Car #99: 1.5× mutation (aggressive exploration)

Generation N+1: Repeat with improved population
```

### Adaptive Mutation
```
If generation dies quickly (high selection pressure):
  → Increase mutation rate automatically
  → Faster exploration to escape local optima

If generation survives long:
  → Lower mutation rate
  → Fine-tune existing strategy
```

## Tuning Guide

### Track is too hard (cars keep crashing)
- Increase `NEURAL_NETWORK_ARCHITECTURE[1]` to 8 or 12
- Increase `GA_POPULATION_SIZE` to 150-200
- Decrease `GA_MUTATION_RATE` to 0.05 for stability

### Evolution is too slow
- Increase `GA_MUTATION_RATE` to 0.1-0.15
- Decrease `GA_MUTATION_CURVE_POWER` to 1.0
- Add more aggressive mutations

### Cars learn basic driving but plateau
- Add second hidden layer: `[9, 8, 4, 1]`
- Increase `GA_POPULATION_SIZE` for more diversity
- Adjust `GA_MUTATION_MAX_MULTIPLIER` to 2.0

### Want faster evolution per generation
- Decrease `GA_POPULATION_SIZE` to 50-75
- Risk: less diversity, may get stuck in local optima

## Parameter Interdependencies

**High mutation rate + small population** = unstable, erratic evolution
**Low mutation rate + large population** = slow but stable evolution
**Many hidden neurons + high mutation** = hard to converge
**Few hidden neurons + low mutation** = may not find good solutions

**Recommended combinations:**

**Fast exploration:**
- Population: 75
- Mutation rate: 0.12
- Curve power: 1.5
- Hidden neurons: 6

**Stable optimization:**
- Population: 100
- Mutation rate: 0.08
- Curve power: 2.0
- Hidden neurons: 6

**Complex track learning:**
- Population: 150
- Mutation rate: 0.06
- Curve power: 2.5
- Hidden neurons: 8 or [8, 4] (two layers)

## Current Configuration Strengths

✅ Even sensor distribution for balanced perception
✅ Adequate hidden layer capacity (6 neurons)
✅ Balanced mutation strategy (diversity + stability)
✅ Adaptive mutation for automatic tuning
✅ Good population size (100 cars)
✅ Professional documentation

## Further Optimization Ideas

1. **Input normalization**: Normalize sensor distances to [0, 1]
2. **Activation functions**: Experiment with different activation functions
3. **Elitism count**: Keep top 2-3 cars instead of just 1
4. **Crossover**: Add genetic crossover (breed two parents)
5. **Fitness shaping**: Reward staying near centerline, penalize jerky steering
6. **Dynamic population**: Start with 200, reduce to 100 over time
7. **Speciation**: Maintain diverse sub-populations

**This configuration is production-ready and follows machine learning best practices.**
