## Self-Driving Cars... But Make It Chaos 🏎️💨

I gave 100 cars a brain and told them to figure out driving. No instructions. No training data. Just vibes and natural selection. 🧬

**The setup:**
- Each car has sensors (it can "see" walls)
- A tiny neural network decides: turn left or right?
- Bad drivers die. Good drivers make babies. Repeat.

**The result:** After a few hundred generations, these little idiots actually learned to drive! 🎉

🧠 **15 different brain architectures** compete simultaneously — which activation function wins out?

The best part? Watching Generation 1 slam into walls like it's their job, then Generation 50 gracefully drifting corners like tiny Torettos 🏁
